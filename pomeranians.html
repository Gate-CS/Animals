    <h1>Pomeranians are my favorite dog breed.</h1>
    <h1>Pomeranians are a dog breed that are very fluffy.
    They are about 5 to 15 lbs and they are quite small, about the size of a soccer ball, but their fur makes them look bigger. </h1>
    <h1>Pomeranians come in 3 main colors, black, white, and golden brown, but they can be a mix of any of those.</h1>
    <h1>It's possible to have a pomeranian that is any color, because you can just dye a white one to be the color you want (The pomeranian probably won't enjoy it though).</h1>
    <h1>Pomeranians mostly eat meat and other stuff I guess.</h1>

    <h1>I love the hedgehog.</h1>
    <h1>Animal Mochi are small and squishy (not alive) animals.</h1>

    <h1>I've always wanted a hedgehog because they're so adorble.</h1>
